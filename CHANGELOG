#====================================

Version 2.11.0 released 2016/03/28

- Added a new function hypre_BoomerAMGSetKeepTranspose, which will store the
  transposes of the interpolation operators and then replace the multiplication
  of the transpose of P with a more efficient matvec.

- Added a new function hypre_BoomerAMGSetRAP2, which will replace the triple
  matrix product R*A*P by two matrix-matrix products. This has shown to be
  faster on BG/Q. Note that setting this function will prevent the keeping of
  transposes.

- Added various changes that can improve performance on certain architectures,
  particularly in the BoomerAMG Setup when using threading. While some of them
  will be in effect automatically, using the configure options --with-openmp
  --enable-hopscotch can lead to additional improvements if atomic operations
  are available.  The configure option --enable-persistent allows the use of
  persistent communication if available. (Many of these changes are described in
  "High-Performance Algebraic Multigrid Solver Optimized for Multi-Core Based
  Distributed Parallel Systems" by J. Park, M. Smelyanskiy, U.M. Yang,
  D. Mudigere, P. Dubey, published in Proceedings of SC15.)

  HYPRE_BoomerAMGSetAddTruncFactor to HYPRE_BoomerAMGSetMultAddTruncFactor
  HYPRE_BoomerAMGSetAddPMaxElmts to HYPRE_BoomerAMGSetMultAddPMAxElmts

- Replaced the function HYPRE_BoomerAMGSetNonGalerkTol, which sets parameters

- Added new non-Galerkin coarse grid construction scheme to reduce communication
  and complexity.

- Extended GLVis visualization to all 2D and 3D example codes.

- Changed the configure settings to use --disable-global-partition by default.
  The equivalent old option --with-no-global-partition is still available, but
  users should migrate to the new one.

#====================================

Version 2.9.4a released 2013/11/21

- Minor bug fix in AMS and other minor changes.

#====================================

Version 2.9.3a released 2013/10/15

- Extended AMS to work for AMR problems on quad/hex meshes by removing an
  assumption that the discrete gradient G only has +-1 entries.  Also changed
  default smoother in AMS to l1-GS.

- Added a hi-D capability to Struct and SStruct.  Use the --enable-maxdim option
  to configure the library for higher-than-3D usage.

- Added complex system support to a subset of the library, including most of the
  matrix-vector class functions and the Krylov solvers.  Currently does not
  support the FEI or babel components.  Use the --enable-complex option to set.

#====================================

Version 2.9.2a released 2013/02/15

- Added HYPRE_AMSSet*AMGCoarseRelaxType for specifying the coarsest level
  relaxation for the AMG subspace solvers in AMS.  Since the subspace matrices
  are often singular, the default value uses l1-GS on the coarsest level, which
  is different from BoomerAMG's default (exact solve).

- Fixed a bug in the IJ interface related to setting off-processor values when
  hypre is configured to use the assumed partition.

- Fixed a bug in BoomerAMG when using C-F L1-Jacobi on coarsest grid, and fixed
  a memory bug related to interpolation.

#====================================

Version 2.9.1a released 2013/01/16

- Added a HYPRE_BoomerAMGSetRedundant() switch to allow for an agglomeration
  approach for solving the coarsest grid system.

- Changed how BoomerAMG handles zero diagonal entries.

- Made a few minor bug fixes in BoomerAMG.

- Fixed a configuration problem with external blas and lapack.

#====================================

Version 2.9.0b released 2012/10/30

- Changed the behavior of the BoomerAMG interpolation routines when a zero
  diagonal is encountered to avoid divide-by-zero issues.

#====================================

Version 2.8.3a released 2012/09/28

- Fixed some memory allocation problems in SStruct, including code related to
  the SetPeriodic() routine.

- Updated the CMake build system to build the FEI component of hypre also.

- Flattened the directory structure for the FEI code.

#====================================

Version 2.8.2a released 2012/05/10

- Added threading to multipass interpolation in BoomerAMG.

- Fixed a coarsening problem in PFMG when the diagonal is negative.

- Added a new option to BoomerAMG to specify a minimum coarse grid size.

#====================================

Version 2.8.1a released 2012/03/19

- For non-cell data, fixed a memory problem with SStructGraphAddEntries() and an
  accumulation problem with SStructMatrixAddValues().

- Improved the penalty scaling factor for AMS's discrete divergence term (which is
  added to the matrix to robustly handle problems with pure void regions).

- Added threading to various routines in BoomerAMG.

- Fixed the SStructGridSetPeriodic() routine to work for all object types,
  including HYPRE_PARCSR which previously did not work.

- Made two changes to GMRES: 1) Added GMRESSetSkipRealResidualCheck to skip the
  evaluation and check of the final residual in GMRES. This can be useful in
  situations where restart is not expected to be beneficial. 2) Independent of the
  above, added a check to see if consecutive real GMRES residuals decrease (in the
  "false convergence" case). If not, we conclude that restart leads to pollution
  from round-off errors and exit GMRES.

- Implemented a CMake build system for the library and the test drivers.

#====================================

Version 2.8.0b released 2011/11/14

- Added the new Auxiliary-space Divergence Solver (ADS) which targets div-div
  problems discretized with lowest order Raviart-Thomas "face" finite elements.
  ADS is very similar to AMS, and in general its relationship to AMS is
  analogous to the relationship between AMS and AMG.

- Added a redundant coarse-grid solve option to BoomerAMG, which can improve
  solution times on machines with high communication latencies.

- Extended the AMS and ADS solvers to support (arbitrary) high-order H(curl) and
  H(div) discretization methods.  The high-order interface allows the users to
  set directly the Nedelec and Raviart-Thomas interpolation matrices, which can
  be used to precondition other types of discretizations (e.g. ones based on the
  second family of Nedelec elements).

- Added a Euclid preconditioner option to the Fortran interfaces for the ParCSR
  Krylov solvers.

- Fixed a bug with periodic problems in the SStruct interface.

- Fixed a bug in CGNR.

- Added a new higher order FEM example (ex16).

- Added visualization capabilities to the examples based on the GLVis package.

#====================================

Version 2.7.1a released 2011/03/18

- Fixed a long-standing O(P) memory allocation problem in the communication
  setup routines for Struct.

- Fixed some OpenMP threading problems in Struct.

- Made some optimizations to the constant coefficient version of PFMG.

- Added a 64-bit version of Example 15 (file 'ex15big.c' in examples/)

#====================================

Version 2.7.0b released 2011/01/27

- Added a new --enable-bigint feature that, when turned on, requires the user to
  pass integers of size 'long long int' to hypre and enables ParCSR matrices with
  more than 2 billion unknowns (previously a limitation due to 32-bit integers).
  This feature is currently not available in the FEI or babel sections of hypre.
  Added example 'ex5big.c' as an illustration of how to use this new feature.

- Changed the Fortran interface to use a Fortran MPI communicator.  Previously,
  users were required to call HYPRE_MPI_Comm_f2c() to convert their Fortran
  communicator to a C communicator.  Fortran users will need to remove this call
  from their code to use the new release.

- Added a new version of the l1-SGS smoother in BoomerAMG as a replacement for
  relax type 8.  This smoother behaves similarly to relax type 6 on matrices
  with relatively small off-processor entries, but is guaranteed to always be
  convergent.  The new smoother is also available in AMS as relax type 4.

- Fixed some bugs in the coarsening routines for BoomerAMG.

- Relaxed the power-of-two restrictions for the PFMG and SysPFMG solvers.  See
  the reference manual for more details.  SMG still requires a power-of-two.

- Fixed the constant-coefficient PFMG solvers.  Also changed the non-Galerkin
  scheme slightly for the constant-coefficient variable-diagonal PFMG solver to
  simplify the code and enable easier threading.

- Fixed a bug in the Struct multigrid solvers for periodic problems when the
  period is larger than the grid.

- Fixed some OpenMP problems in the Struct and SStruct code.

#====================================

Version 2.6.1a released 2010/03/30

- Made several bug fixes related to the new SetSharedPart() and FEM() routines:
  Fixed a memory leak.  Fixed to allow SetSharedPart() or SetNeighborPart()
  calls from any processor, even if the processor doesn't own data on 'part'.

- Fixed a bug in the void-zone version of AMS, which sometimes produced a
  non-symmetric preconditioner.

- Added new smoothers to BoomerAMG (Chebyshev, FCF-Jacobi, and CG) and
  AMS (Chebyshev).

- Made some performance improvements to the implementation of the assumed
  partition algorithm used in SStruct.

#====================================

Version 2.6.0b released 2010/02/04

- Added a new interface routine to SStruct called GridSetSharedPart() which is
  used to describe how regions inside a part are shared with regions in other
  parts in a block-structured grid setting.  The routine is similar to
  SetNeighborPart(), but allows more flexibility in finite-element settings.

- Added new finite element routines to the SStruct interface as an alternative
  to using stencils: GridSetFEMOrdering(), GraphSetFEM(), GraphSetFEMSparsity(),
  MatrixAddFEMValues(), and VectorAddFEMValues().

- Added new examples, ex13.c, ex14.c, and ex15.c, to illustrate the use of the
  new SetSharedPart and FEM routines, the new rectangular matrix feature in
  SStruct, and the use of the AMS solver through the SStruct interface.

- Removed support for SetNeighborBox() in the SStruct interface.  This was
  replaced by SetNeighborPart() in release 2.4.0b.

- Added the assumed partition algorithm to the implementation of the SStruct
  interface to improve scaling at huge processor counts.

- Changed the behavior of IJMatrixSetValues so that it is deterministic and
  consistent with the behavior of SStructMatrixSetValues when setting values
  owned by other processors (a similar change was made to IJVectorSetValues).

- Added user documentation for building hypre under Windows.

- Added user and reference documentation for the LOBPCG eigensolver.

- Did some cleaning up in the 'configure' script.

- Changed to install only one hypre library now: libHYPRE.a (or libHYPRE.so).

- Added the release number to the hypre shared library soname and changed to
  resolve all symbols in the shared library.

- Updated the non-babel fortran interface.

- Added configure options to explicitly set the mangling scheme for Fortran.

- Added a configure option to --disable-fortran for users who do not have a
  working fortran compiler.  This is most useful for Mac users.

- Improved threading for BoomerAMG.

#====================================

Version 2.5.0a released, 2009/10/12.

- Added new 2-stage interpolation operators to be used with aggressive
  coarsening.

- Added a new routine HYPRE_BoomerAMGSetMaxCoarseSize that allows to set the
  maximal system size on the coarsest level.

- Added a "recompute residual" option to PCG which makes it behave like a
  "restarted CG".  This, can be useful in high-accuracy computation where the
  CG residuals drift from r = b - Ax.

- Added a residual-based stopping criteria in PCG for high-accuracy
  computations.

- Added a Fortran interface for AMS.

- Initial release of a more robust version of AMS for singular problems with
  zero-conductivity regions.  This requires a list of the interior nodes in the
  zero conductivity regions and uses a periodic projection onto a compatible
  subspace.

- Added Distributed SuperLU in the FEI.

- Added support for multiple right-hand-sides in the FEI.

- Added C and Fortran nodal versions of Example 1: ex12.c and ex12f.f.

- Added a LOBPCG example: /examples/ex11.c.

- Removed the make uninstall option.

- The HTML version of the reference manual is no longer part of the hypre
  distribution.  However, it can still be generated by typing make in the docs/
  directory (requires doc++).

#====================================

Version 2.4.0b released 2008/08/08

- Fixed some Fortran interface bugs.

- Added two additional Krylov solvers: Flexible GMRES and LGMRES

- Added a fortran example: /examples/ex5f.f

- Updated SuperLU to version 3.0

- Improved relaxation options in AMS.

- Changed 'make clean' to erase the hypre/ directory.

- Fixed a bug in preconditioned BiCGStab.

#====================================

Version 2.3.2a released, 2008/05/08.

- Fixed a couple of bugs associated with SStructGridSetNeighborPart.

- Added absolute convergence tolerance stopping criteria to GMRES, CG, and
  BiCGStab (See HYPRE_GMRESSetAbsoluteTolerance, HYPRE_PCGSetAbsoluteTolerance,
  or HYPRE_BiCGSTABSetAbsoluteTolerance in the reference manual for details).

- Updated error checking for CG and BiCGStab.

- Fixed a bug in AMG when the maximum number of levels is set to 1.

- Added two new solver types to AMS: a Hiptmair-like smoother (type 0), and
  one based on a block 4x4 coarse-grid matrix (type 20).

#====================================

Version 2.3.1a released, 2008/01/31.

- A bug fix (uninitialized variables introduced when AMS was added to
  the FEI preconditioner list).

- Fixed a memory allocation bug in new SStruct SetNeighborPart feature.

- Added a new option for the Schwarz smoothers
  (HYPRE_BoomerAMGSetSchwarzUseNonSymm and HYPRE_SchwarzSetNonSymm) to use LU
  instead of Cholesky LAPACK functions to invert the matrix blocks.

- Fixed a bug with the Schwarz smoothers and the ESSL compile.

#====================================

Version 2.3.0a released, 2008/01/28.

- Completed the implementation of SStructGridSetNeighborBox to work for all
  variable types (not just cell-centered).  In the process, we discovered that
  the interface design for this routine can result in ambiguous coordinate
  transformations between parts, so the new SetNeighborPart routine (below)
  should be used instead.

- Introduced the SStructGridSetNeighborPart routine.  Users migrating from
  SetNeighborBox to this new routine only need to change the name ("Box" to
  "Part") and append an additional argument 'index_dir'.  See the reference
  manual for details.

- The SStructSplit solver can now be used as a standalone solver (before, it
  could only be used as a preconditioner).  Added HYPRE_Jacobi as an option to
  SetStructSolver.

- Added Get(Box)Values routines for Struct/SStruct Matrix.

- Added nodal interpolation schemes to BoomerAMG for systems problems.

- Added capability to change Euclid runtime parameters using individual
  functions.

- Improved use of Euclid as smoother in BoomerAMG.

- Fixed two potential bugs in BoomerAMG.

- Fixed a major bug with the OpenMP code in hypre (beginning with v1.7.5b,
  OpenMP support was effectively disabled in the code).  Also made several
  additional OpenMP changes/fixes.

#====================================

Version 2.2.0b released, 2007/09/20.

- Renovate the FEI block preconditioner which will be useful for ALE3D
  simulation of mixed variable type problem

#====================================

Version 2.1.0a released, 2007/06/25.

- Added the CGC and CGC-E coarsening algorithms, which have been developed
  and implemented by Michael Griebel, Bram Metsch and Alex Schweitzer of
  the University of Bonn.

- Added several new solver types to AMS and improved the AMS/FEI integration.

- Better handling of the relative change test in GMRES.

- Improved weights for Struct and SStruct weighted Jacobi.

- Added a 'make check' target that does a simple code verification test.

- Added truncation for interpolation according to the number of elements to the
  ParCSR Hybrid AMG Solver.

- Renovated the hypre fei implementation for use in ARES.

#====================================

Version 2.0.0 released, 2006/12/15.

- Minor documentation updates.

#====================================

Version 1.14.0b released, 2006/11/30.

- Added python support to Babel interface.

- Changed the name of several internal header files to use the '_hypre_' prefix.
  This should not affect most users, since these are internal headers.

- Added AME, a new Maxwell eigensolver based on AMS and LOBPCG.

- Changes to Struct code to hopefully improve efficiency of MG solver setup.

- Efficiency improvements for new long-range interpolation algorithms in
  BoomerAMG, including:
    * extended interpolation is now like modified, i.e no absolute values
    * added an extended interpolation which only extends when there are no
      common coarse neighbors
    * changed standard interpolation to only extend at strong F neighbors
      (instead of all neighbors) for better efficiency

#====================================

Version 1.13.0b released, 2006/10/03.

- Babel-based interface updated to Babel version 1.0.0, plus various
  improvements, such as an interface to the hypre error handler.  Pre-built
  interfaces are included for C, Fortran, and C++.

- Various modifications to BoomerAMG:
  * Eliminated the possibility to set relaxation on the finest grid
  * Added various new long-range interpolation algorithms: standard (with and
    without weight separation), extended, and F-F interpolation.  These routines
    will improve convergence for the low complexity coarsening algorithms PMIS
    and HMIS.
  * Added the possibility to set a maximal number of weights per row <n> when
    truncating the interpolation operator.  When this option is used, only the
    absolutely largest <n> weights per row are kept.

- Modifications to the fac user interface to permit easier problem set up.

- Shared libraries can be built by using the --enable-shared option when
  configuring.  NOTE: the directory where the shared libraries reside MUST be
  defined in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.

- Incorporated the GNU Lesser General Public License.

- Now using Roundup for issue tracking; send email to hypre-support@llnl.gov

#====================================

Version 1.12.0a released, 2006/07/26.

- First release of AMS, a new solver for (semi)definite Maxwell problems.

- First release of Maxwell, a semi-structured Maxwell solver.

- Modifications to the fac user interface to permit easier set up of the problem.

#====================================

Version 1.11.1b released, 2006/05/30.

- Corrected FEI build to allow user to specify a system FEI and build internal
  HYPRE routines.

#====================================

Version 1.11.0b released, 2006/04/24.

- Added configure option --without-FEI to disable build of internal FEI
  routines.

- Added a new system for handling error codes in hypre.

- Added configure option --print-errors to enable printing of HYPRE error
  messages.

- Modified configure to only depend on having a C compiler available.

- Added compatible relaxation on one processor.

- Updated all F90_HYPRE_* files to be consistent with HYPRE_* files.

- Updated ex5.c to include:
    * an option to print the system matrix and rhs
    * a description of how to read in a matrix and rhs in IJ format.

- Corrected error that occurred when more than one Euclid solver object is used
  at the same time

- Added Maxwell capabilities via Sandia's ML solvers; see details in
  FEI_mv/fei-hypre/CHANGELOG.

- Replaced PILUT with Euclid in test code sstruct.c.

#====================================

Version 1.10.0b released, 2005/12/19.

- configure updates
    * always runs --without-blas --without-lapack unless otherwise specified
    * cross-compiling enabled
    * added --with-no-global-partition option

- makefile updates
    * changed eigensolvers subdirectory to multivector

- Added a set of simple example codes covering the Struct, SStruct and IJ
  interfaces.  See README.html in the examples subdirectory for more details.

- The --with-no-global-partition option was added to reduce storage and improve
  run times on very large numbers of processors (such as BlueGene/L).  Currently
  only the IJ interface solvers have been optimized.  For small or modest
  numbers of processors (typically < 1000-5000 depending on the machine), this
  option is not needed (and will likely be slower).

- Added aggressive coarsening, which can be applied to all available coarsening
  schemes (via HYPRE_BoomerAMGSetNumAggLevels and HYPRE_BoomerAMGSetNumPaths)

- Added multipass interpolation and direct interpolation.

- Added the capability of nodal coarsening for systems AMG.

- expanded coverage of Babel-based interface

#====================================

Version 1.9.0b released, 2005/02/10.

- Added updated LOBPCG source code and test files.

- Added a vector Laplace problem for testing systems AMG.

- Added FAC to semi-struct

#====================================

Version 1.9.0a released, 2005/01/18.

- NOTE: Link lines may need to be changed depending on configure options used.

- The build system introduced in v1.8.3a was too difficult to maintain, so we
  have reverted to a system similar to the previous one.  In particular, all of
  the new automake and libtool stuff was removed.  In the new system, each
  directory (except 'config') has ONLY a 'Makefile' (no more 'Makefile.in' or
  'Makefile.am' files).  When the 'configure' script is run, the single file
  'config/Makefile.config' is created.  This file is included in all Makefiles
  in all sub-directories.  Shared libraries CANNOT be created with this system.

- The makefile targets are now more inline with GNU standards.  To get details,
  type 'make help'.

- The makefile target 'nofei' has been removed and is now run by default.

- The library files 'libHYPRE_blas.a' and 'libHYPRE_lapack.a' are no longer
  created when 'configure' is run '--without-blas' and/or '--without-lapack'.
  This created confusion before and really didn't make sense anyway.  These
  options are now consistent with the '--without-MPI' option.  Also, there is
  no longer any danger of name conflicts with external blas or lapack libraries
  as was the case before.

- Added new parallel coarsening schemes PMIS and HMIS with reduced complexities
  as well as the option of using one pass of Ruge-Stueben only.

- Added the capability to set values from any processor through the IJ matrix
  and vector interfaces.

- Added support to the PFMG solver for matrices with constant coefficients.

- Reverted back to the first approach for setting periodic conditions.  The
  periodic flag now contains the periodicity value, and is not just a boolean.

#====================================

Version 1.8.3a released, 2004/01/21.

- The build system has been revamped to enable the building of shared
  libraries (in addition to static libraries, as before).  The new
  system more closely follows GNU standards, and will hopefully show
  improved flexibility and platform support.  Users can build hypre
  as before by typing 'configure' followed by 'make'.  A few makefile
  target changes to note are:

    * 'make clean' replaces 'make veryclean'
    * 'make all' no longer builds the drivers in the 'test' directory.
       If needed, build them from within the 'test' directory or
       use the 'make test' target.

  Technical notes: We are now using GNU automake-1.8.2 to support
  Makefile.in generation; autoconf-2.59 to generate configure; and
  libtool-1.5 to provide shared library support.  The GNU tools,
  autoheader, libtoolize, and aclocal are also used.  These tools are
  only used by hypre developers and are *not* needed to build hypre.

- Separated the lapack and blas routines into two libraries.  Blas and
  lapack support (whether to use the routines distributed with hypre or
  use already installed libraries) is determined by configure, and can
  be overridden with '--with-blas=<lib>' and '--with-lapack=<lib>'.
  NOTE: This change affects your link line!

- A new directory 'lib' contains a new Hypre library, 'libHYPRE.a' (and
  'libHYPRE.so' if configured for shared libraries) which contain
  all of the libHYPRE_*.a objects with in a single library.

- Fixed the PFMG and SMG solvers to work in the case of pure Neumann
  boundary conditions.

#====================================

Version 1.8.2b released, 2003/10/22.

- Performance improvements for Struct solvers when there are many
  boxes per processor in the grid.  For 125 boxes or more in 3D,
  the speedup in the setup phases of PFMG and SMG can be significant
  (we have seen as much as a factor of 30).

- New non-Galerkin option in PFMG can improve convergence and memory
  usage.  This option maintains either a 5-pt stencil in 2D or a 7-pt
  stencil in 3D on all grid levels.

- New non-symmetric red/black smoother in PFMG can improve
  convergence on some problems.

- New optimizations in the smoothers in PFMG lead to as much as 30%
  faster times.

- Added a new interpolation option to AMG that is useful for solving
  hyperbolic equations.  It treats fine weak connections like fine
  strong connections.

#====================================

Version 1.8.1b released, 2003/05/21.

- Minor bug fixes and performance improvements.

#====================================

Version 1.8.0b released, 2003/04/08.

- New Babelized HYPRE interface introduced.  Babel is a tool that
  provides language interoperability.  HYPRE will eventually migrate
  to using Babel exclusively.  See 'docs/babel_transition_info.txt' for
  information on how to use the new interface.

- PFMG: bug fix for red/black relaxation.

- Eigenvalue solver LOBPCG has been added.  See 'docs/lobpcg_info.txt'
  for documentation.

#====================================

Version 1.7.11a released, 2003/03/14.

- BiCGSTAB has been added to struct and sstruct interface

- added automatic determination of relaxation parameters for use with symmetric
  smoothers in BoomerAMG

#====================================

Version 1.7.10b released, 2002/12/02.

- New Hybrid solvers available for ParCSR and Struct.

- IJ: Modified the 'GetValues' part of the matrix interface to make
  it possible to get matrix values without knowing the nonzero
  structure.  In particular, added a new option to IJMatrixGetValues,
  and added new routines IJMatrixGetRowCounts, IJMatrixGetLocalRange,
  and IJVectorGetLocalRange.

- SStruct: Fixed a bug when connecting a part to itself with SetNeighborBox.

- FEI: Added a few more smoothers and amg methods in mli, fixed a few memory
  leaks uncovered by running ale3d, added new aggregation coarsening for
  handling multiple materials.  For more details, see
  FEI_mv/fei-hypre/CHANGELOG.

#====================================

Version 1.7.9b released, 2002/10/18.

- SStruct: Added an if around sorting and eliminating duplicate
  iUventries so that its only executed when there are at least 2
  such entries.

#====================================

Version 1.7.8b released, 2002/09/25.

- SStruct: Changed the MatrixSetSymmetric interface (this was actually
  not implemented before anyway).  The new interface allows much more
  flexibility in controlling which parts of the matrix are symmetric.

#====================================

Version 1.7.7b released, 2002/08/08.

- limited release SStruct optimizations testing
- the krylov library has been renamed to HYPRE_krylov

#====================================

Version 1.7.6b released, 2002/03/27.

- SStruct: Changed SetNeighborBox function to allow the case where the
  NeighborBox does not even intersect the grid.  This functionality
  is convenient in some application situations.

- SStruct: Made additional changes to the SetNeighborBox function to
  allow NeighborBox information to be redundantly declared by users.
  This functionality is also convenient in some application situations.

- SStruct: Optimized the implementation of MatrixSetBoxValues.

#====================================

Version 1.7.5b released, 2002/01/16.

- SStruct: Modified SetNeighborBox boxes to reach off of the global grid.

- krylov solvers (PCG, GMRES, BiCGSTAB and CGNR ) are the first
  solvers to use the new definitions for logging, which are
  logging = 0: no printout,  no storing of norms or rel. res. norms
  logging = 1: no printout,  norms (and relative residual norms for PCG)
               are stored
  logging > 1: norms (and relative residual norms for PCG) are stored
               and printed out to standard output during each iteration
               step.

#====================================

Version 1.7.0b released, 2001/11/12.

- Bug fixes: SStruct interface under threads was producing incorrect
  results. That is now fixed.

#====================================

Version 1.6.0 released, 2001/07/27.

- The Euclid PILU preconditioning library has been added to the release.
  See Section 7.7.5 of the user manual and Section 6.6.4 of the reference
  manual for details.

#====================================

Version 1.5.0b released, 2001/07/18.

- New draft of the IJ interface: This new draft is not backward compatible
  with the previous draft.  See the file `docs/V1.5.0b.IJ_transition_info'
  for details on transitioning to the new interface.  See the User's Manual
  and Reference Manual for usage information.

- Added SetRelChange option to GMRES solver.

#====================================

Version 1.4.0b released, 2001/01/10.

- Changed SStruct interface: The SStructGraphAddEntries routine now
  only sets one graph entry at a time.  See the reference manual for
  details on the new prototype and usage.

- Both PCG and GMRES are available now when using the Struct or SStruct
  matrix classes (only one or the other was previously available).

#====================================

- First working multiprocessor version of SStruct interface.

- Fixed a bug in PILUT that effected multiprocessor runs.

- Additional interface for Krylov solvers: most function calls are
  available with more generic naming, e.g. HYPRE_PCGSetPrecond
  may be called instead of HYPRE_ParCSRPCGSetPrecond or
  HYPRE_StructPCGSetPrecond.

#====================================

Version 1.3.1b released, 2000/10/12.

#====================================

Version 1.3.0b released, 2000/10/11.

- The number of threads to use in an OpenMP run can now be specified via
  either the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable, or by the routine
  omp_set_num_threads().

- Added fortran interface support for compilers that mangle names with
  all capitals (e.g., Cray fortran compilers).  To use, specify the
  '--with-CFLAGS=-DHYPRE_CRAY' option on the 'configure' line.

#====================================

Version 1.2.0 released, 2000/09/22.

#====================================

Version 1.1.0 released, 2000/09/07.

- Setup time for PILUT has been dramatically reduced in the case of
  very small drop tolerances, and memory problems that were causing
  coredumps on >2 processors have been fixed.

- Changed Struct interface include file names to be consistent with
  the rest of the library.  They are now:

    HYPRE_struct_mv.h
    HYPRE_struct_ls.h

  The Struct library names have also changed similarly.

- Removed the `stencil' argument from `HYPRE_StructVectorCreate'.

- Added a new interface for semi-structured grids.  This is still very
  much a beta implementation, and should be used with extreme caution
  until further notice.

- The main header files have been restructured to be more readable.
  They will soon include full documentation for their interfaces.

#====================================

New internal installation: V1.0.0, 2000/07/06

- Now installing both optimized and debugging versions of the library.
  The optimized library is in the usual place; the debugging library
  is in the subdirectory 'debug'.

- Added support for the FEI v1.4, with additional capabilities for handling
  parallel slide surface reduction and general Schur complement reduction.

- Using a new version numbering scheme.  The C macro HYPRE_Version()
  may be used to retrieve version information.

#====================================

New internal installation: V2000-05-31

- OpenMP threading added to BoomerAMG.

  to convert code to use the new names.

- Changed default coarsening type for BoomerAMG.  This version does
  Ruge/Stueben coarsening on the interior of each processor to generate
  an initial independent set for the CLJP coarsening algorithm.

- Various BoomerAMG optimizations.

#====================================

New internal installation: V2000-03-30

- New AddToValues and AddToBoxValues routines for Struct interface.

- Fairly extensive changes to SMG/PFMG codes to fix setup phase
  scalability problems.  These changes should result in slightly
  slower setup phase times for small-scale problems, but much
  improved setup phase times for very large-scale (greater than
  1000 processors) problems.

- AMG and GMRES solvers have minor fixes for reproducibility under
  restart.

- A subtle coarse grid operator bug in AMG was removed.  AMG no longer
  frees from an uninitialized pointer to an empty domain coarse grid
  operator.

- Minimum iteration count controls have been installed for AMG, GMRES,
  and CGNR.

- Fortran interface wrappers have been made for ParCSRMatrixMatvec and
  ParCSRMatrixMatvecT calls

#====================================

New internal installation: V2000-01-14
