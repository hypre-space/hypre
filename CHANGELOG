#=============================================================================
# This file chronicles user-level changes to hypre, beginning with the most
# recent release.
#=============================================================================


#====================================

Version 2.3.2a released, 2008/05/08.

- Fixed a couple of bugs associated with SStructGridSetNeighborPart.

- Added absolute convergence tolerance stopping criteria to GMRES, CG, and
  BiCGStab (See HYPRE_GMRESSetAbsoluteTolerance, HYPRE_PCGSetAbsoluteTolerance,
  or HYPRE_BiCGSTABSetAbsoluteTolerance in the reference manual for details).

- Updated error checking for CG and BiCGStab.

- Fixed a bug in AMG when the maximum number of levels is set to 1.

#====================================

Version 2.3.1a released, 2008/01/31.

- A bug fix (uninitialized variables introduced when AMS was added to
  the FEI preconditioner list).

- Fixed a memory allocation bug in new SStruct SetNeighborPart feature.

- Added a new option for the Schwarz smoothers
  (HYPRE_BoomerAMGSetSchwarzUseNonSymm and HYPRE_SchwarzSetNonSymm) to use LU
  instead of Cholesky LAPACK functions to invert the matrix blocks.

- Fixed a bug with the Schwarz smoothers and the ESSL compile.

#====================================

Version 2.3.0a released, 2008/01/28.

- Completed the implementation of SStructGridSetNeighborBox to work for all
  variable types (not just cell-centered).  In the process, we discovered that
  the interface design for this routine can result in ambiguous coordinate
  transformations between parts, so the new SetNeighborPart routine (below)
  should be used instead.

- Introduced the SStructGridSetNeighborPart routine.  Users migrating from
  SetNeighborBox to this new routine only need to change the name ("Box" to
  "Part") and append an additional argument 'index_dir'.  See the reference
  manual for details.

- The SStructSplit solver can now be used as a standalone solver (before, it
  could only be used as a preconditioner).  Added HYPRE_Jacobi as an option to
  SetStructSolver.

- Added Get(Box)Values routines for Struct/SStruct Matrix.

- Added nodal interpolation schemes to BoomerAMG for systems problems.

- Added capability to change Euclid runtime parameters using individual
  functions.

- Improved use of Euclid as smoother in BoomerAMG.

- Fixed two potential bugs in BoomerAMG.

- Fixed a major bug with the OpenMP code in hypre (beginning with v1.7.5b,
  OpenMP support was effectively disabled in the code).  Also made several
  additional OpenMP changes/fixes.

#====================================

Version 2.2.0b released, 2007/09/20.

- Renovate the FEI block preconditioner which will be useful for ALE3D
  simulation of mixed variable type problem

#====================================

Version 2.1.0a released, 2007/06/25.

- Added the CGC and CGC-E coarsening algorithms, which have been developed 
  and implemented by Michael Griebel, Bram Metsch and Alex Schweitzer of 
  the University of Bonn.

- Added several new solver types to AMS and improved the AMS/FEI integration.

- Better handling of the relative change test in GMRES.

- Improved weights for Struct and SStruct weighted Jacobi.

- Added a 'make check' target that does a simple code verification test.

- Added truncation for interpolation according to the number of elements to the 
  ParCSR Hybrid AMG Solver.

- Renovated the hypre fei implementation for use in ARES.

#====================================

Version 2.0.0 released, 2006/12/15.

- Minor documentation updates.

#====================================

Version 1.14.0b released, 2006/11/30.

- Added python support to Babel interface.

- Changed the name of several internal header files to use the '_hypre_' prefix.
  This should not affect most users, since these are internal headers.

- Added AME, a new Maxwell eigensolver based on AMS and LOBPCG.

- Changes to Struct code to hopefully improve efficiency of MG solver setup.

- Efficiency improvements for new long-range interpolation algorithms in
  BoomerAMG, including:
    * extended interpolation is now like modified, i.e no absolute values
    * added an extended interpolation which only extends when there are no
      common coarse neighbors
    * changed standard interpolation to only extend at strong F neighbors
      (instead of all neighbors) for better efficiency

#====================================

Version 1.13.0b released, 2006/10/03.

- Babel-based interface updated to Babel version 1.0.0, plus various
  improvements, such as an interface to the hypre error handler.  Pre-built
  interfaces are included for C, Fortran, and C++.

- Various modifications to BoomerAMG:
  * Eliminated the possibility to set relaxation on the finest grid
  * Added various new long-range interpolation algorithms: standard (with and
    without weight separation), extended, and F-F interpolation.  These routines
    will improve convergence for the low complexity coarsening algorithms PMIS
    and HMIS.
  * Added the possibility to set a maximal number of weights per row <n> when
    truncating the interpolation operator.  When this option is used, only the
    absolutely largest <n> weights per row are kept.

- Modifications to the fac user interface to permit easier problem set up.

- Shared libraries can be built by using the --enable-shared option when
  configuring.  NOTE: the directory where the shared libraries reside MUST be
  defined in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.

- Incorporated the GNU Lesser General Public License.

- Now using Roundup for issue tracking; send email to hypre-support@llnl.gov

#====================================

Version 1.12.0a released, 2006/07/26.

- First release of AMS, a new solver for (semi)definite Maxwell problems.

- First release of Maxwell, a semi-structured Maxwell solver.

- Modifications to the fac user interface to permit easier set up of the problem.
  
#====================================

Version 1.11.1b released, 2006/05/30.

- Corrected FEI build to allow user to specify a system FEI and build internal
  HYPRE routines.

#====================================

Version 1.11.0b released, 2006/04/24.

- Added configure option --without-FEI to disable build of internal FEI
  routines.

- Added a new system for handling error codes in hypre.

- Added configure option --print-errors to enable printing of HYPRE error
  messages.

- Modified configure to only depend on having a C compiler available.

- Added compatible relaxation on one processor.

- Updated all F90_HYPRE_* files to be consistent with HYPRE_* files.

- Updated ex5.c to include:
    * an option to print the system matrix and rhs
    * a description of how to read in a matrix and rhs in IJ format.

- Corrected error that occured when more than one Euclid solver object is used
  at the same time

- Added Maxwell capabilities via Sandia's ML solvers; see details in
  FEI_mv/fei-hypre/CHANGELOG.

- Replaced PILUT with Euclid in test code sstruct.c.

#====================================

Version 1.10.0b released, 2005/12/19.

- configure updates
    * always runs --without-blas --without-lapack unless otherwise specified
    * cross-compiling enabled
    * added --with-no-global-partition option

- makefile updates
    * changed eigensolvers subdirectory to multivector

- Added a set of simple example codes covering the Struct, SStruct and IJ
  interfaces.  See README.html in the examples subdirectory for more details.

- The --with-no-global-partition option was added to reduce storage and improve
  run times on very large numbers of processors (such as BlueGene/L).  Currently
  only the IJ interface solvers have been optimized.  For small or modest
  numbers of processors (typically < 1000-5000 depending on the machine), this
  option is not needed (and will likely be slower).
  
- Added aggressive coarsening, which can be applied to all available coarsening
  schemes (via HYPRE_BoomerAMGSetNumAggLevels and HYPRE_BoomerAMGSetNumPaths)

- Added multipass interpolation and direct interpolation.

- Added the capability of nodal coarsening for systems AMG.

- expanded coverage of Babel-based interface

#====================================

Version 1.9.0b released, 2005/02/10.

- Added updated LOBPCG source code and test files.

- Added a vector Laplace problem for testing systems AMG.

- Added FAC to semi-struct

#====================================

Version 1.9.0a released, 2005/01/18.

- NOTE: Link lines may need to be changed depending on configure options used.

- The build system introduced in v1.8.3a was too difficult to maintain, so we
  have reverted to a system similar to the previous one.  In particular, all of
  the new automake and libtool stuff was removed.  In the new system, each
  directory (except 'config') has ONLY a 'Makefile' (no more 'Makefile.in' or
  'Makefile.am' files).  When the 'configure' script is run, the single file
  'config/Makefile.config' is created.  This file is included in all Makefiles
  in all sub-directories.  Shared libraries CANNOT be created with this system.

- The makefile targets are now more inline with GNU standards.  To get details,
  type 'make help'.

- The makefile target 'nofei' has been removed and is now run by default.

- The library files 'libHYPRE_blas.a' and 'libHYPRE_lapack.a' are no longer
  created when 'configure' is run '--without-blas' and/or '--without-lapack'.
  This created confusion before and really didn't make sense anyway.  These
  options are now consistent with the '--without-MPI' option.  Also, there is
  no longer any danger of name conflicts with external blas or lapack libraries
  as was the case before.

- Added new parallel coarsening schemes PMIS and HMIS with reduced complexities
  as well as the option of using one pass of Ruge-Stueben only.

- Added the capability to set values from any processor through the IJ matrix
  and vector interfaces.

- Added support to the PFMG solver for matrices with constant coefficients.

- Reverted back to the first approach for setting periodic conditions.  The
  periodic flag now contains the periodicity value, and is not just a boolean.

#====================================

Version 1.8.3a released, 2004/01/21.

- The build system has been revamped to enable the building of shared
  libraries (in addition to static libraries, as before).  The new
  system more closely follows GNU standards, and will hopefully show
  improved flexibility and platform support.  Users can build hypre
  as before by typing 'configure' followed by 'make'.  A few makefile
  target changes to note are:

    * 'make clean' replaces 'make veryclean'
    * 'make all' no longer builds the drivers in the 'test' directory.
       If needed, build them from within the 'test' directory or
       use the 'make test' target.

  Technical notes: We are now using GNU automake-1.8.2 to support
  Makefile.in generation; autoconf-2.59 to generate configure; and
  libtool-1.5 to provide shared library support.  The GNU tools,
  autoheader, libtoolize, and aclocal are also used.  These tools are
  only used by hypre developers and are *not* needed to build hypre.

- Separated the lapack and blas routines into two libraries.  Blas and
  lapack support (whether to use the routines distributed with hypre or
  use already installed libraries) is determined by configure, and can
  be overridden with '--with-blas=<lib>' and '--with-lapack=<lib>'.
  NOTE: This change affects your link line!

- A new directory 'lib' contains a new Hypre library, 'libHYPRE.a' (and
  'libHYPRE.so' if configured for shared libraries) which contain
  all of the libHYPRE_*.a objects with in a single library.

- Fixed the PFMG and SMG solvers to work in the case of pure Neumann
  boundary conditions.

#====================================

Version 1.8.2b released, 2003/10/22.

- Performance improvements for Struct solvers when there are many
  boxes per processor in the grid.  For 125 boxes or more in 3D,
  the speedup in the setup phases of PFMG and SMG can be significant
  (we have seen as much as a factor of 30).

- New non-Galerkin option in PFMG can improve convergence and memory
  usage.  This option maintains either a 5-pt stencil in 2D or a 7-pt
  stencil in 3D on all grid levels.

- New non-symmetric red/black smoother in PFMG can improve
  convergence on some problems.

- New optimizations in the smoothers in PFMG lead to as much as 30%
  faster times.

- Added a new interpolation option to AMG that is useful for solving
  hyperbolic equations.  It treats fine weak connections like fine
  strong connections.

#====================================

Version 1.8.1b released, 2003/05/21.

- Minor bug fixes and performance improvements.

#====================================

Version 1.8.0b released, 2003/04/08.

- New Babelized HYPRE interface introduced.  Babel is a tool that
  provides language interoperability.  HYPRE will eventually migrate
  to using Babel exclusively.  See 'docs/babel_transition_info.txt' for
  information on how to use the new interface.

- PFMG: bug fix for red/black relaxation.

- Eigenvalue solver LOBPCG has been added.  See 'docs/lobpcg_info.txt'
  for documentation.

#====================================

Version 1.7.11a released, 2003/03/14.

- BiCGSTAB has been added to struct and sstruct interface

- added automatic determination of relaxation parameters for use with symmetric
  smoothers in BoomerAMG

#====================================

Version 1.7.10b released, 2002/12/02.

- New Hybrid solvers available for ParCSR and Struct.

- IJ: Modified the 'GetValues' part of the matrix interface to make
  it possible to get matrix values without knowing the nonzero
  structure.  In particular, added a new option to IJMatrixGetValues,
  and added new routines IJMatrixGetRowCounts, IJMatrixGetLocalRange,
  and IJVectorGetLocalRange.

- SStruct: Fixed a bug when connecting a part to itself with SetNeighborBox.

- FEI: Added a few more smoothers and amg methods in mli, fixed a few memory 
  leaks uncovered by running ale3d, added new aggregation coarsening for 
  handling multiple materials.  For more details, see 
  FEI_mv/fei-hypre/CHANGELOG.

#====================================

Version 1.7.9b released, 2002/10/18.

- SStruct: Added an if around sorting and eliminating duplicate 
  iUventries so that its only executed when there are at least 2 
  such entries.

#====================================

Version 1.7.8b released, 2002/09/25.

- SStruct: Changed the MatrixSetSymmetric interface (this was actually
  not implemented before anyway).  The new interface allows much more
  flexibility in controlling which parts of the matrix are symmetric.

#====================================

Version 1.7.7b released, 2002/08/08.

- limited release SStruct optimizations testing
- the krylov library has been renamed to HYPRE_krylov

#====================================

Version 1.7.6b released, 2002/03/27.

- SStruct: Changed SetNeighborBox function to allow the case where the
  NeighborBox does not even intersect the grid.  This functionality
  is convenient in some application situations.

- SStruct: Made additional changes to the SetNeighborBox function to
  allow NeighborBox information to be redundantly declared by users.
  This functionality is also convenient in some application situations.

- SStruct: Optimized the implementation of MatrixSetBoxValues.

#====================================

Version 1.7.5b released, 2002/01/16.

- SStruct: Modified SetNeighborBox boxes to reach off of the global grid.

- krylov solvers (PCG, GMRES, BiCGSTAB and CGNR ) are the first
  solvers to use the new definitions for logging, which are 
  logging = 0: no printout,  no storing of norms or rel. res. norms 
  logging = 1: no printout,  norms (and relative residual norms for PCG) 
               are stored 
  logging > 1: norms (and relative residual norms for PCG) are stored 
               and printed out to standard output during each iteration 
               step. 

#====================================

Version 1.7.0b released, 2001/11/12.

- Bug fixes: SStruct interface under threads was producing incorrect
  results. That is now fixed.

#====================================

Version 1.6.0 released, 2001/07/27.

- The Euclid PILU preconditioning library has been added to the release.
  See Section 7.7.5 of the user manual and Section 6.6.4 of the reference
  manual for details.

#====================================

Version 1.5.0b released, 2001/07/18.

- New draft of the IJ interface: This new draft is not backward compatible
  with the previous draft.  See the file `docs/V1.5.0b.IJ_transition_info'
  for details on transitioning to the new interface.  See the User's Manual
  and Reference Manual for usage information.

- Added SetRelChange option to GMRES solver.

#====================================

Version 1.4.0b released, 2001/01/10.

- Changed SStruct interface: The SStructGraphAddEntries routine now
  only sets one graph entry at a time.  See the reference manual for
  details on the new prototype and usage.

- Both PCG and GMRES are available now when using the Struct or SStruct
  matrix classes (only one or the other was previously available).

#====================================

- First working multiprocessor version of SStruct interface.

- Fixed a bug in PILUT that effected multiprocessor runs.

- Additional interface for Krylov solvers: most function calls are
  available with more generic naming, e.g. HYPRE_PCGSetPrecond
  may be called instead of HYPRE_ParCSRPCGSetPrecond or
  HYPRE_StructPCGSetPrecond.

#====================================

Version 1.3.1b released, 2000/10/12.

#====================================

Version 1.3.0b released, 2000/10/11.

- The number of threads to use in an OpenMP run can now be specified via
  either the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable, or by the routine
  omp_set_num_threads().

- Added fortran interface support for compilers that mangle names with
  all capitals (e.g., Cray fortran compilers).  To use, specify the
  '--with-CFLAGS=-DHYPRE_CRAY' option on the 'configure' line.

#====================================

Version 1.2.0 released, 2000/09/22.

#====================================

Version 1.1.0 released, 2000/09/07.

- Setup time for PILUT has been dramatically reduced in the case of
  very small drop tolerances, and memory problems that were causing
  coredumps on >2 processors have been fixed.

- Changed Struct interface include file names to be consistent with
  the rest of the library.  They are now:

    HYPRE_struct_mv.h
    HYPRE_struct_ls.h

  The Struct library names have also changed similarly.

- Removed the `stencil' argument from `HYPRE_StructVectorCreate'.

- Added a new interface for semi-structured grids.  This is still very
  much a beta implementation, and should be used with extreme caution
  until further notice.

- The main header files have been restructured to be more readable.
  They will soon include full documentation for their interfaces.

#====================================

New internal installation: V1.0.0, 2000/07/06

- Now installing both optimized and debugging versions of the library.
  The optimized library is in the usual place; the debugging library
  is in the subdirectory 'debug'.

- Added support for the FEI v1.4, with additional capabilities for handling
  parallel slide surface reduction and general Schur complement reduction. 

- Using a new version numbering scheme.  The C macro HYPRE_Version()
  may be used to retrieve version information.

#====================================

New internal installation: V2000-05-31

- OpenMP threading added to BoomerAMG.

  to convert code to use the new names.

- Changed default coarsening type for BoomerAMG.  This version does
  Ruge/Stueben coarsening on the interior of each processor to generate
  an initial independent set for the CLJP coarsening algorithm.

- Various BoomerAMG optimizations.

#====================================

New internal installation: V2000-03-30

- New AddToValues and AddToBoxValues routines for Struct interface.

- Fairly extensive changes to SMG/PFMG codes to fix setup phase
  scalability problems.  These changes should result in slightly
  slower setup phase times for small-scale problems, but much
  improved setup phase times for very large-scale (greater than
  1000 processors) problems.

- AMG and GMRES solvers have minor fixes for reproducibility under
  restart.

- A subtle coarse grid operator bug in AMG was removed.  AMG no longer
  frees from an uninitialized pointer to an empty domain coarse grid
  operator.

- Minimum iteration count controls have been installed for AMG, GMRES,
  and CGNR.

- Fortran interface wrappers have been made for ParCSRMatrixMatvec and
  ParCSRMatrixMatvecT calls

#====================================

New internal installation: V2000-01-14
