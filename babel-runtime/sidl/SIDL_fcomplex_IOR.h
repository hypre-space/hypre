 * dimension or potentially less assuming the original array has
 * dimension greater than 1.  If you are removing dimension, indicate the
 * dimensions to remove by setting numElem[i] to zero for any dimension i
 * that should go away in the new array.  The meaning of each argument
 * is covered below.
 * 
 * src       the array to be created will be a subset of this array. If
 *           this argument is NULL, NULL will be returned. The array
 *           returned borrows data from src, so modifying src or the
 *           returned array will modify both arrays.
 * 
 * dimen     this argument must be greater than zero and less than or
 *           equal to the dimension of src. An illegal value will cause
 *           a NULL return value.
 *           
 * numElem   this specifies how many elements from src should be taken in
 *           each dimension. A zero entry indicates that the dimension
 *           should not appear in the new array.  This argument should be
 *           an array with an entry for each dimension of src.  Passing
 *           NULL here will cause NULL to be returned.  If
 *           srcStart[i] + numElem[i]*srcStride[i] is greater than
 *           upper[i] for src or if srcStart[i] + numElem[i]*srcStride[i]
 *           is less than lower[i] for src, NULL will be returned.
 * 
 * srcStart  this array holds the coordinates of the first element of the
 *           new array. If this argument is NULL, the first element of
 *           src will be the first element of the new array. If non-NULL,
 *           this argument should be an array with an entry for each
 *           dimension of src.  If srcStart[i] is less than lower[i] for
 *           the array src, NULL will be returned.
 * 
 * srcStride this array lets you specify the stride between elements in
 *           each dimension of src. This stride is relative to the
 *           coordinate system of the src array. If this argument is
 *           NULL, the stride is taken to be one in each dimension.
 *           If non-NULL, this argument should be an array with an entry
 *           for each dimension of src.
 * 
 * newLower  this argument is like lower in a create method. It sets the
 *           coordinates for the first element in the new array.  If this
 *           argument is NULL, the values indicated by srcStart will be
 *           used. If non-NULL, this should be an array with dimen
 *           elements.
