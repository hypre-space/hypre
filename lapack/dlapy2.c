    Purpose   
    =======   

    DLAPY2 returns sqrt(x**2+y**2), taking care not to cause unnecessary   
    overflow.   

    Arguments   
    =========   

    X       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION   
    Y       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION   
            X and Y specify the values x and y.   

    ===================================================================== */
