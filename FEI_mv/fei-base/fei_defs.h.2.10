   In this file we set some #defines to use as parameters to
   some fei functions, and also some error-code returns.
   We also provide the typedef for 'GlobalID' which appears in
   many FEI function prototypes. Note that the default case is
   for GlobalID to simply be an int.
   This file is included by both C and C++ versions of the fei.
