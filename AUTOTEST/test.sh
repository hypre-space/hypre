   $0 [options] {testname}.sh [{testname}.sh args]

    where: {testname} is the user-defined name for the test script

    with options:
       -h|-help       prints this usage information and exits
       -t|-trace      echo each command

   This script runs the Bourne shell test '{testname}.sh' and creates output
   files named '{testname}.err' and '{testname}.out' which capture the stderr
   and stdout output from the test.  The test script is run from the current
   directory, which should contain this script, '{test_name}.sh', and any other
   supporting files.

   A test is deemed to have passed when nothing is written to stderr.  A test
   may call other tests.  A test may take arguments, such as directories or
   files.  A test may also create output, which should be collected by the test
   in a directory named '{testname}.dir'.  A test may also require additional
   "filtering" in situations where information is erroneously written to stderr.
   Text identifying lines to be filtered are added to '{testname}.filters'.
   Usage documentation should appear at the top of each test.

   Example usage: $0 configure.sh ../src
