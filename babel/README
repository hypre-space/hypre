Babel Interface:

This directory contains the Babel wrappers for Hypre.
The building instructions here assumes that Babel is 
already installed on the local system and that the rest 
of Hypre is already constructed.

1.  Locate where the babel compiler is installed.  If
    Its already in your path, try `where babel`.
    It should look like /<some_path>/bin/babel.

2.  Type './configure --with-babeldir=/<some_path>'
    where <some_path> is the actual path that was determined
    in step 1.

4.  Type 'make'.  This will build the Hypre/libhypre_class.a.

5.  Type 'make check'.  This will build test/testum.
