<a href="ex2.c.html"><h2>Example 2</h2></a>
<p>
This is a two processor example and is similar to the previous
structured interface example (Example 1). However, in
this case the grid boxes are exactly those in the example
diagram in the struct interface chapter of the User's Manual.
(Processor 0 owns two boxes and processor 1 owns one box.)
The solver is PCG with SMG preconditioner.

We recommend viewing example 1 before viewing this
example.
