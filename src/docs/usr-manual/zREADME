Note:
  - Added '_static/custom.css' file for customizations (document this somewhere)
  - To add unicode characters (e.g., umlaut characters), use 'M-x
    insert-character' in emacs and type in the name of the unicode character
    (use the web to get a list of names).  For example, '00FB' is "umlaut u".


Issues and things left to do:

     - Remember to change 'checklist' in hypre-dev repo when this branch is merged
     - MathJax is slow to render.  Are we okay with that?  Is there a better alternative?
     - How to reference figures?
     - How to combine images in a figure.  Create one PNG file from the combination?
     - Add the hypre logo somehow
     - Copyright stuff and date (ref manual)
DONE - Copyright stuff (user manual), version numbers
DONE - References need to be done
DONE - Figure images need to be regenerated from original source files
