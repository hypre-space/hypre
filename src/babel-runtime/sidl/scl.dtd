The SCL file describes libraries and the sidl classes each library
contains.  The library element indicates where the shared library is
stored (a local file name or a URI), whether it should be loaded into
a global or local scope (this impacts dlopen flags), and whether its
symbols should be resolved using a lazy algorithm (resolve symbols as
referenced) or immediately. The library description can also contain a
md5 or sha1 digest or both. This is particularly recommended when the
uri refers to a binary outside your control. The uri can be a shared
library (often .so) or a libtool metadata file when the uri is a local
filename. md5 or sha1 should contain the digest as a hexidecimal
string (such as you would get from the md5sum or sha1sum programs).

The class element has two attributes: name and desc. The name
attribute should b e a fully qualified sidl type name (e.g.,
sidl.BaseClass). The desc attribute is matched against the
target argument of sidl.Loader.findLibrary, so it can be anything.
Presently, Babel uses "ior/impl" to indicate that a library
contains the implementation of a class and "java" to indicate that
a library contains the "java" client-side native methods for a
class.

<!--
The class element describes a sidl class inside a library.
The name attribute is the full sidl type name including
package hierarchy and class (e.g., sidl.BaseClass). The
desc attribute is a string indicating what information
relating to the class is stored in the library. A desc
of "ior/impl" means the IOR and implementation of the
class are stored in the library. This is useful for
sidl.DLL.createClass calls. A desc of "java" means the
Java client-side native methods are stored in the library.
