Every patch to a named release should include a two line file in this
directory. The filename should be 14 characters or less and end with
".txt".  The filename before ".txt" should be a brief name for the patch.

The first line of the file should be a terse description of what the patch
solves in language that's understandable by Babel end users. The second line
should be an email address associated with the person issuing the patch.
