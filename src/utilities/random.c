/******************************************************************************

 *   author = {S. K. Park and K. W. Miller},
 *   title = {Random number generators: good ones are hard to find},

 *   volume = {31},
 *   number = {10},
 *   year = {1988},
 *   pages = {1192--1201},
 * }
 *
 * This RNG has been shown to appear fairly random, it is a full period
 * generating function (the sequence uses all of the values available to it up
 * to 2147483647), and can be implemented on any architecture using 32-bit
 * integers. The implementation in this file will not overflow for 32-bit
 * arithmetic, which all modern computers should support.
